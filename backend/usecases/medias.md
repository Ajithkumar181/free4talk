Certainly! Here's a professional and structured version of the backend use cases for the 📎 media\_files module, incorporating your provided MySQL table schema:

## 📎 6. media\_files

Manages media uploads, metadata storage, and associations with chat messages.

### Table: `media_files`

| Field        | Type         | Description                                               |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| id           | int          | Primary key, auto-increment media ID                      |
| uploader\_id | int          | User ID who uploaded the media                            |
| file\_url    | varchar(255) | URL or path where the file is stored                      |
| file\_type   | varchar(50)  | MIME type or file extension (e.g., image/png, audio/mpeg) |
| uploaded\_at | timestamp    | Timestamp when the file was uploaded                      |

### 📌 Primary Backend Use Cases:

1. **📤 Upload Media File**

   * Accept media file uploads from the client (image, audio, video, documents).
   * Validate file type and size according to allowed media policies.
   * Store the media securely (cloud storage or file server).
   * Insert a new record into `media_files` capturing `uploader_id`, `file_url`, `file_type`, and `uploaded_at`.
   * Return the generated `id` (media\_id) and `file_url` to the client for reference.

2. **🔗 Associate Media with Messages**

   * When a message contains media, associate it by saving the corresponding `media_id` in the `messages` table.
   * This enables retrieval of media related to each message.

3. **🖼️ Generate and Serve Media Previews**

   * Provide clients with secure and possibly time-limited URLs to access media previews or full files.
   * Support generation of thumbnails or optimized preview versions to improve client-side performance.

4. **🔍 Retrieve Media Metadata**

   * Fetch media details such as `file_type` and `uploaded_at` for rendering and filtering in client applications.
   * Support filtering media by type or uploader.

5. **🧹 Manage Media Lifecycle**

   * Support deletion of media records and files when messages or groups are deleted, ensuring no orphaned files remain.
   * Optionally implement retention policies or archival strategies to optimize storage usage.
