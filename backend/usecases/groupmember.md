Great! Based on your actual `group_members` table schema, here is the professionally structured backend use cases with the exact table details included:

---

## ðŸ‘¤ 8. group\_members

Tracks which users belong to which groups, their roles, and membership timestamps.

### Table: `group_members`

| Column     | Type                                      | Null | Key | Default            | Description                              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---- | --- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| group\_id  | INT                                       | NO   | PRI | NULL               | Foreign key referencing `groups`         |
| user\_id   | INT                                       | NO   | PRI | NULL               | Foreign key referencing `users`          |
| joined\_at | TIMESTAMP                                 | YES  |     | CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP | Timestamp when the user joined the group |
| role       | ENUM('admin','co-admin','member','guest') | YES  |     | 'member'           | Role of the user in the group            |

### ðŸ“Œ Backend Use Cases

1. **Add User to Group**

   * Insert a record in `group_members` with `group_id`, `user_id`, `role` (default 'member'), and `joined_at` (defaults to current timestamp).
   * Validate user is not already a member of the group before insertion.
   * Optionally notify the group or the user of membership addition.

2. **Remove User from Group**

   * Delete the record from `group_members` for the specified `group_id` and `user_id`.
   * Enforce permission checks so only authorized users (e.g., admins/co-admins) can remove members.
   * Update group-related caches or notify remaining members if necessary.

3. **List Members of a Group**

   * Query all records from `group_members` filtered by `group_id`.
   * Return user IDs, roles, and joined\_at timestamps.
   * Support pagination for groups with many members.

4. **Update Member Role**

   * Update the `role` field for a given `group_id` and `user_id`.
   * Typically used to promote/demote members to/from 'admin', 'co-admin', 'member', or 'guest'.
   * Enforce strict permissions so only admins can modify roles.
   * Log role changes for audit or notification purposes.

5. **Fetch Membership Information**

   * Retrieve details such as the date a user joined and their role for UI or analytics.
   * Use this data to show "joined at" timestamps or role badges in the group UI.

If you want, I can also help draft example SQL queries or API endpoints based on these use cases. Would you like that?
