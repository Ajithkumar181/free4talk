### Backend Use Cases:

1. **üÜï Create Notification**

   * Insert a new record into `notifications` with:

     * `user_id`: Recipient user ID
     * `type`: One of `'message'`, `'call'`, `'friend_request'`
     * `content`: Descriptive text or metadata for the notification
     * `is_read`: Default to 0 (unread)
     * `created_at`: Auto-generated timestamp

2. **üìñ Mark Notification as Read**

   * Update `is_read` flag to 1 when the user views or acknowledges the notification.
   * Support single or bulk updates (e.g., "mark all as read").

3. **üîç Retrieve Notifications by User**

   * Query notifications filtering by `user_id`.
   * Support sorting by `created_at` descending (most recent first).
   * Support pagination and filters (e.g., unread only, filter by type).

4. **üîî Provide Notification Counts**

   * Count unread notifications (`is_read = 0`) for badge counts in UI.

5. **üì≤ Push Notifications / Real-time Feeds**

   * Prepare notification payloads for UI or mobile push notifications.
   * Integrate with WebSocket or push services for real-time alerting.

6. **üóëÔ∏è Notification Retention & Cleanup (Optional)**

   * Implement background jobs to archive or delete old notifications to optimize storage.
