## üìû 4. Contacts ‚Äì Table Purpose and Backend Use Cases

The `contacts` table is designed to manage a user's personal contact list, providing efficient access to frequently interacted users (friends or recent connections). It improves performance and user experience by supporting faster lookups, status badges, and recent interactions.

### üß© Why This Table Is Used

| Purpose                  | Explanation                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contact Sync             | Helps maintain a cache of known/frequent contacts for each user           |
| Performance Optimization | Enables faster queries than searching large friend/message tables         |
| Real-Time Status Display | Supports showing online/offline indicators directly in contact list       |
| Contact Prioritization   | Can rank or sort users by interaction frequency, recency, or custom logic |
| Frontend Display         | Easily populate the "Contacts", "Chats", or "Friends" tabs in UI          |

### üóÇÔ∏è Sample Schema: contacts

| -------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| user\_id             | INT (FK)  | The owner of the contact list               |
| contact\_id          | INT (FK)  | The contact (friend or frequently messaged) |
| last\_interacted\_at | TIMESTAMP | Last time this user interacted with contact |
| is\_favorite         | BOOLEAN   | Marked as favorite (optional)               |
| added\_at            | TIMESTAMP | When the contact was first added            |

### ‚úÖ Backend Use Cases

---

#### 1. Auto-Sync Friend List

Automatically update the contacts list when new friendships are accepted.

üõ† Logic:

* On friend request accepted:

```sql
INSERT INTO contacts (user_id, contact_id, added_at)
VALUES (?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE added_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

‚û°Ô∏è Ensures the contact appears in the user‚Äôs list after becoming friends.

---

#### 2. Quickly Lookup Recent/Active Contacts

Enables fast retrieval of the most recently interacted or most active contacts.

üõ† Query example:

```sql
SELECT contact_id
FROM contacts
WHERE user_id = ?
ORDER BY last_interacted_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

‚û°Ô∏è Useful for displaying recent chats or prioritizing UI views.

---

#### 3. Show Online/Offline Badge in UI

The `contact_id` list allows efficient cross-reference with the user\_status table to show online indicators.

üõ† Join example:

```sql
SELECT c.contact_id, us.is_online
FROM contacts c
JOIN user_status us ON c.contact_id = us.user_id
WHERE c.user_id = ?;
```

‚û°Ô∏è Supports features like green dots for online users in the chat sidebar.

### üß† Optional Enhancements

| Feature                   | Description                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Interaction Weighting     | Add weight or frequency score for sorting      |
| Custom Nicknames          | Allow renaming contacts locally                |
| Blocked Contact Filtering | Exclude blocked users from contact lists       |
| Contact Groups or Tags    | Enable grouping (e.g., "Work", "Family", etc.) |

Let me know if you'd like to add caching strategies, syncing with the friends table, or optimize for NoSQL alternatives.
